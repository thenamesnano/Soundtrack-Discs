<h3>About Soundtrack Discs</h3>
<p>Soundtrack Discs was an idea originally posted by user boingobongo69 on the Minecraft Forum.
I was looking for new mod ideas when I happened upon the post and decided to take on the project.
The mod adds in various music discs with the Minecraft OST so that you can play them on demand.</p>
<p>This is a good-faith modification, but if C418 wants it taken down I will do so.</p>

<h3>Songs Included</h3>
<ul>
<li>Minecraft</li>
<li>Clark</li>
<li>Sweden</li>
<li>Subwoofer Lullaby</li>
<li>Living Mice</li>
<li>Haggstrom</li>
<li>Danny</li>
<li>Key</li>
<li>Oxyg√®ne</li>
<li>Dry Hands</li>
<li>Wet Hands</li>
<li>Mice on Venus</li>
</ul>

<h3>To Modpack Developers</h3>
<p>Do whatever you want with the mod buy please don't bundle it on the Technic platform.
That ecosystem is terrible and many mod creators including myself do not support it.
Ultimately I cannot stop you nor do I care to try, but if you want to do right by me then credit with links is appreciated.</p>
